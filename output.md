## How will the different approaches in parallelism (and concurrency) affect the solution's scalability?

## What tools will you use for autoscaling? 


------------------------------------------ 

## Please consider Kubernetes (GKE) 

- Considered


## Suggest the best way for resource allocation and how we may solve the autoscaling


## Will you prefer horizontal or vertical autoscaling?

## What metrics will you use as inputs for autoscaling?
